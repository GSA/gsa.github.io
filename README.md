# DEPRECATED
The current [open.gsa.gov](http://open.gsa.gov) site now sits at https://github.com/GSA/open-gsa-redesign. Any further edits/issue should be done there. Contact the GSA Digital Service Team or CTO office for questions.


# Open.gsa.gov

A developer hub to share GSA data, APIs, and code.  

Modified from the [outstanding open source work of our sister agency](https://github.com/cfpb/cfpb.github.io), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  

## [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/) metadata

The [`data.json`](data.json) file is GSA's machine-readable list of open data sources. See [the schema definition](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) for information about the structure of the file. Note this is what feeds [the GSA's open data list on data.gov](http://catalog.data.gov/organization/gsa-gov). [More information about getting data into data.gov.](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov/)
