Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) Data Center Closures 2010-2015. Under the FDDCI, agencies have categorized their agency data center populations into two categories: core and non-core. The government is closing 40% of agency-identified, non\u00adcore data centers, while optimizing agency-identified core-data centers, according to a series of total cost of ownership metrics (see OMB M-13-09 and OMB M-14-08). This dataset reflects information only for agency-identified, non-core closures. All questions or inquiries should be directed to the specific agencies. The FY2010 through FY2015 dataset provides a list of planned or closed data centers by agency and by city\/state location since the FDCCI started. Please note \u0091OTHER\u0092 is listed for data centers in cloud, co-located or managed service data centers, where square footage is unavailable.
