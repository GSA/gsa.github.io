      <p>NARA is working to build a cohesive national framework for public programs and reference services that will improve awareness and promote access to all of NARA’s archival holdings.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>Research Services standardized days of operation at our facilities across the country to eliminate differences and increase staff availability to researchers.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Research Services greatly increased the amount of researcher education videos available through NARA’s YouTube channel by placing our popular “Know Your Records” series online in 2015.&nbsp; Along with our virtual Genealogy Fair, these videos provide a wide range of information about finding and using NARA holdings.&nbsp; By April 2016 Research Services had placed 42 videos on NARA’s YouTube Channel, Know Your Records <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC641EF0E3F8AFDF9">playlist</a>. Popular topics include FOIA, Genealogy, Black History, and Records Available Online.<br />
      &nbsp;</p>

      <p>Quarterly, our <em>Researcher News</em> publication continues to bring information about services and holdings at the National Archives to researchers. <em>Researcher News</em> was first made available online in 2014 to expand access to information for researchers and staff. This quarterly online <a href="http://www.archives.gov/research/newsletter/">newsletter</a> is designed to provide researchers with the most up-to-date information needed to conduct research at the National Archives.&nbsp; An email blast goes to 1,800 subscribing individuals and organizations across the U.S. and world including Vatican City, Australia, and Ireland. On Facebook, our latest issue had 1,520 views.</p>

      <p>We are working to update and modernize online content to provide the most consistent, helpful, and easily understood information about using records and services at NARA’s research locations across the country. We are working to improve the ability of users to find answers to such questions as availability, where to go, how to use, where to inquire, and what time to visit. We plan to review, revise, reorganize, and update reference information to improve pathfinding along topical or subject lines. We will also develop new content that will better inform researchers about newly accessioned records and plans for enhanced description projects, such as subject or topical guides.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>Over 18 million records have been made available for searching through the Access to Archival Databases (AAD). Over 700,000 digital images were uploaded to the National Archives Catalog for download.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Research Services has been reviewing, revising, reorganizing, and updating selected online information about holdings and services in order to improve usability and better inform researchers about holdings and services. In 2015 we developed or revised online reference information on Archives.gov that included:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Guide to the Records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs</li>
        <li>U.S. Court Records Held by the National Archives</li>

      <p>In conjunction with the CIA, NARA will examine and pilot the use of new tools to provide archivists and classification reviewers with search capability for legacy unstructured data and automate initial document analysis, beginning with classified Presidential email records from the Reagan Administration.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>The CIA and NARA completed the pilot project. The CIA and NARA partnered with scientists from the Center for Content Understanding (CCU) at the Applied Research Laboratories (ARL) at the University of Texas at Austin to develop a series of technological tools that the government would be able to use to assist classification and declassification decision-making.&nbsp; With the cooperation of the CIA and NARA, the CCU successfully piloted the Sensitive Content Identification and Marking (SCIM) tool on restored email from the Reagan administration. The CCU also re-formatted and parsed the email records to be machine-readable, which was critical to solving issues of obsolesce when reviewing born-digital electronic records for declassification. The CIA and NARA completed quality control reviews on the records to confirm the results of the pilot project. They also started a discussion of next steps for additional use of the SCIM technology for actual decision-making support for declassification review at the CIA, the Presidential libraries and the NDC. This Open Government Proposed Action was also included in NAP 2.0 and continuation of these projects is in NAP 3.0. To learn more about the pilot, see the video from the Public Interested Declassification Board (PIDB) meeting in June 2015 at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ApwyaB4ldQ">Youtube.com/watch?v=2ApwyaB4ldQ</a><br />

      <p>Pending funding, the George W. Bush Library will collaborate with the Office of Innovation on a pilot project to scan selected FOIA-responsive records. This project will entail scanning textual records and creating necessary metadata so that these records can be made available on the agency’s online catalog, the Online Public Access (OPA) system.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>This pilot project was undertaken at the William J. Clinton Presidential Library. The library and the Office of Innovation collaborated on a project to digitize the highest demand Freedom of Information Act collections.&nbsp; The project created high quality scans along with corresponding metadata for the purpose of adding these images to the National Archives Catalog.&nbsp; The pilot established a team for the project, developed a successful workflow that included both the scanning and metadata creation, compiled accurate statistics and exceeded all project goals.&nbsp; While the pilot is officially completed, the project continues at this time.&nbsp; It is serving as a roadmap for discerning and establishing best practices and lessons learned in the hopes that other parts of NARA can build on this success.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update:   </strong>In 2015 Research Services led an important initiative to implement a new approach to the Archives Technician career field. We established a new Archives Technician (GS-1421) position description that allows for development from the 5 to 7 level. 143 employees were hired in 2015/2016 on this new position description. We also launched an Archives Technician Development Program which provides the training needed to meet competencies and skills required for advancement.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In 2016 Research Services launched a group to update and standardize the Archivist Performance Plans (GS-1420) across Research Services.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update:   </strong>SEPMs worked in collaboration with NARA offices to evaluate policies, procedures, and practices to help create a work environment that supports fair and open competition for all employees regardless of their differences; fosters learning; promotes individual development opportunities; analyze workforce data to help identify existing and/or potential barriers to employment and makes recommendations to eliminate barriers. Seven SEPM workgroups have been developed to examine and execute Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) initiatives. A copy of the goals can be requested from the EEO Office.

      <p>NARA will develop a digitization program to support the strategic initiative to digitize our analog archival records. NARA will establish a digitization governance board and update the agency’s digitization strategy. NARA will seek to expand digitization partnerships.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>NARA created a Digitization Division within the Office of Innovation to oversee and manage digitization across the agency. The Division has started reporting on digitization activities across the agency and has become a centralized point for data concerning digitization. In April 2014, the Archivist of the United States chartered the Digitization Governance Board (DGB). The DGB is made up of representatives from all major functions at NARA and meets on a monthly basis to review policy and discuss digitization issues. The board has been very active in all areas of digitization including digitization standards, digital preservation, agency metrics on digitization, and digitization pilots. One of the high points was the issuance of NARA's <a href="http://archives.gov/digitization/strategy.html">Digitization Strategy for 2015-2024</a>.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>NARA has been very active in updating previous agreements with partners and expanding the number of partnerships. This effort came to fruition when NARA signed an agreement with the National Collection of Aerial Photography to digitize NARA's vast holdings of aerial film. Aerial film is challenging to digitize and this partnership agreement ensures that aerial film from D-Day will be available for free to researchers. All of our digitization partnership agreements can be found at <a href="http://www.archives.gov/digitization/partnerships.html">Archives.gov/digitization/partnerships.html</a>.</p>

      <p>NARA will continue to work toward a reduction of its backlog of pending Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>Our current FOIA Backlog, as of April 14, 2016, is 4,979. This represents an increase since April 2014, when the backlog was 4,522 requests.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>However, at the end of Fiscal Year 2015, NARA's backlog was 4,393, which did represent a reduction. Since the start of Fiscal Year 2016, however NARA has seen a significant increase in FOIA requests in several offices. For example, for operational records in Fiscal Year 2015, NARA received a total of 397 FOIA requests. In the first six months of Fiscal Year 2016, NARA received 262 FOIA requests for operational records. This represents a steady increase, which NARA has addressed by bringing on additional FOIA personnel, adding seven FOIA positions in Research Services and one in the Office of General Counsel, which processes all FOIA appeals and initial requests for operational records.</p>

      <p>The National Declassification Center (NDC) will build on the inter-agency collaboration fostered by NDC processes with the implementation of an equity referral automatic notification and tracking system that will automatically notify appropriate representatives of other departments and agencies when classified records containing their classified equities require further declassification review.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>The equity referral automatic notification and tracking system began automated notification of referrals prioritized for agency review in mid-April 2014. Follow-up automated reminders are forwarded to each agency as appropriate and within a rigorous one-year timeline. As of January 2016, all agencies were complying with deadlines. With the implementation of this system, NDC expanded Interagency Referral Center (IRC) work. Since the start of Fiscal Year 2014, 2.2 million pages have been reviewed in the IRC, and 50 percent of those were declassified. The NDC is a partner with the CIA, which manages and funds the Document Declassification Support System (DDSS) platform on which this system is built. Although this federal records-referral capability is operational, automated referral for Presidential records, currently tracked via yearly notification memos, is also desired, but has not been implemented due to an unforeseen reduced 2015–2017 CIA funding stream. This funding concern is a potential weakness that could also impact maintaining the federal records system already is use<strong>. </strong></p>

      <p>Based on the lessons learned as part of processing the backlog, records accessioned since January 2010 will be addressed with quality assurance sampling and other streamlined declassification processing. The NDC goal is to process classified series for quality assurance within one year of their accessioning to NARA, thus eliminating any future equity identification backlog.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>NDC has been successful in achieving this goal. By the close of 2014, NDC had processed all classified series for quality assurance that had been accessioned to NARA between January 2010 and December 2013 (28.4M pages). By the close of 2015, NDC had processed all classified series for quality assurance that had been accessioned to NARA between January and December 2014 (8.6 million pages). Once this quality assurance step is completed, the records are appropriately declassified and released or, if considered as potentially containing still sensitive national security information equities, are placed in agency referral review queues within the NDC Interagency Referral Center.</p>

      <p>NARA is looking to evolve the processing capabilities for electronic records by establishing a flexible Digital Processing Environment (DPE) within the Electronic Records Archives (ERA) “system of systems” concept. The DPE initiative will serve a number of digital processing needs, all with the primary goal of preserving and providing access to electronic records.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>In 2013 NARA began the process of meeting with business owners from across the agency to identify the gaps in functionality and identify requirements to modernize ERA. Development of ERA 2.0 began in fall 2014, proceeding in monthly development increments. In mid-2015 we launched the Pilot Digital Processing Environment with an updated workflow and, a new modular processing environment with a suite of utilities and tools, and a Pilot Digital Object Repository for managed preservation services and storage. The pilot is being tested by over 100 NARA staff members to ensure that this next generation of ERA fits into the new federal frameworks for electronic records management and transfer to NARA. The third pilot update will take place in mid-2016. Development is continuing; the planned production launch is currently scheduled for late 2017.&nbsp; Iterative development will continue after the initial launch, as will the development of an accompanying separate environment for Classified records. The ultimate goal is to greatly expand the functionality of ERA to include workflows for all record types and digitized records, greatly expand the range of tools needed to process records and create public use versions, and to implement a robust preservation environment, all in a framework that makes it easier to update the system to meet developing needs.</p>

      <p>During Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016, the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) will continuously review and analyze the effectiveness of its programs and adjust them with the new grant program outcomes in mind:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Accelerate digital literacy and citizen engagement with primary sources</li>
        <li>Create a nation partnership for digital government with state and local archives</li>
        <li>Expand online publishing of historical records</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>During Fiscal Year 2015 and 2016 the NHPRC sponsored over 130 projects nationwide that expanded online publishing of historical records, created free online digital versions of 18th- through 20th-century historical materials, preserved born-digital materials in state and local governments, and provided Americans with more opportunities to discover and work with primary sources. Outcomes from these projects produced the following results: over 70,000 cubic feet of traditionally formatted archives and over 2,500 MB of born digital records preserved and made available for public use; over 15,000 historical documents fully transcribed, annotated, and published in print and/or online; and 1 million new digital facsimiles created from primary sources.</p>

      <p>NHPRC will continue to add documents to the Founders Online project during Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016 as additional materials become available from the editorial teams that continue their work on the papers of the founding era.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Update: </strong>Since June 2015 we have added almost 9,000 new documents to Founders Online<em> (www.founders.archives.gov)</em>, with this web tool now including over 175,000 fully searchable and transcribed documents from the founding era. Over 2.5 million users have visited Founders Online since its launch in June 2013. Educators, scholarly researchers and historians, authors, genealogists, curators, journalists, and government officials are making use of this powerful and user-friendly discovery tool on an ever-increasing basis.&nbsp;</p>
