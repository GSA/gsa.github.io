### Section 2: Strengthen the Culture of Open Government

Our past plans describe the transformational work NARA has undertaken to ensure that the agency better serves the public and federal agencies. This work included the identification of six transformational outcomes—One NARA, Out in Front, An Agency of Leaders, A Great Place to Work, A Customer-Focused Organization, and An Open NARA—and a reorganization to support these outcomes.

We also undertook the development of a Strategic Plan for 2014-2018. Our Plan describes our new strategic goals and objectives that strengthen open government and our substantial efforts to improve both public and employee engagement.
